# How to communicate effectively with mentors.

* Introduce yourself in the relevant forums.

* Do you have a question? Don't bury that into the long introduction. As introductions flood in, it is easy to miss a question buried into the Introduction message.

* Provide sufficient details in your introduction.

"Hi, I am XX, a third year CS student from University of YY in ZZ. I am experienced in AA, BB, and CC. This summer I am looking forward to contribute to Project Idea #2, because it aligns with my previous experience with projects EE, FF, and GG. My sample contributions can be found here (link) and here (link)." serves as a good intro.

* Ask yourself do you really have a question.

We often receive "questions" - "I am new here. Help me get started." Of course, all the applicants are new. But that is not a question. We cannot "help" everyone when it is not even clear what you want. Check the GSoC's students guide and go through all the links provided in this repository. Go through the repositories, and do your own research before working on your proposal.

Then, when you have specific questions or clarifications, go ahead and post those questions in the relevant Discussion Forums listed under each project idea. Meaningful questions will receive replies. Always check whether someone else has asked the same question before and if your question is already answered. If a real question (not a "Help me get started" or "How can I be successful in GSoC?") remains unanswered, tag the mentors or the org admins.
