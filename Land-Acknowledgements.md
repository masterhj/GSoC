# Land Acknowledgements

As we build a more diverse, equitable and inclusive future, we acknowledge the Indigenous peoples of the land on which we work and live. We honor our Alaska Native peoples.

Most of our current Google Summer of Code (GSoC) developer community (including the Google Summer of Code mentors) is physically based in Dghayitnu in Dena'ina Ełnena and the ancestral lands of the Dena people of the lower Tanana River.

**University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA)**

UAA recognizes and values the diversity of our unique location in Southcentral Alaska, the ancestral lands of the Dena'ina, Ahtna, Alutiiq/Sugpiaq and Eyak/dAXunhyuu Peoples. 

Dena'ina land acknowledgment: Dena'inaq ełnenaq' gheshtnu ch'q'u yeshdu. "I live and work on the land of the Dena'ina." 

Translation: Helen Dick, Sondra Shaginoff-Stuart, Joel Isaak.

**University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF)**

We acknowledge the Alaska Native nations upon whose ancestral lands our campuses reside. In Fairbanks, our Troth Yeddha' Campus is located on the ancestral lands of the Dena people of the lower Tanana River.


**University of Alaska Southeast (UAS)**

Our campuses reside on the unceded territories of the Áakʼw Ḵwáan, Taantʼá Ḵwáan, and Sheetkʼá Ḵwáan on Lingít Aaní, also known as Juneau, Ketchikan, and Sitka, Alaska. We acknowledge that Lingít Peoples have been stewards of the land on which we work and reside since time immemorial, and we are grateful for that stewardship and incredible care.

We also recognize that our campuses are adjacent to the ancestral home of the X̱aadas and Ts’msyen and we commit to serving their peoples with equity and care. We recognize the series of unjust actions that attempted to remove them from their land, which includes forced relocations and the burning of villages. We honor the relationships that exist between Lingít, X̱aadas, and Ts’msyen peoples, and their sovereign relationships to their lands, their languages, their ancestors, and future generations. We aspire to work toward healing and liberation, recognizing our paths are intertwined in the complex histories of colonization in Alaska. We acknowledge that we arrived here by listening to the peoples/elders/lessons from the past and these stories carry us as we weave a healthier world for future generations.
