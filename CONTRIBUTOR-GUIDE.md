# Communicating with the mentors

Each project idea has at least one mentor assigned. We aim to assign two mentors to each accepted project idea to ensure the contributors have continuous mentoring even during a brief absence of a mentor. Each project also has a relevant discussion forum in their GitHub source repository, listed under each project idea. Specific discussions on each project idea happen in those discussion forums.

Please feel free to introduce yourself in the respective project idea's discussion forum or through this GitHub repository's general discussion forum.

## Large (full-time) vs. Medium-size (half-time) vs. Small projects

This year, contributors are given the option to contribute to a project full-time (35 hours a week and 350 hours in total, a large project), half-time (about 18 hours a week and 175 hours in total, a medium-size project), or small (about 90 hours in total). 

Each project idea indicates the effort needed by the hours.

# Application Template

**8) Project Schedule**

Break the timeline into periods of up to 7 days

**8.1) Community Bonding Period**

**8.2) Development Phase**

**8.3) Project Completion, testing, and documentation**

**9) Planned GSoC work hours**

This year, the full-time projects are expected to contribute 35 hours a week (large projects, 350 hours in total), half-time projects are expected to make an 18-hour-a-week contribution (medium-sized size projects, 175 hours total), and small projects, a 90-hour contribution. Please indicate your choice of the project length. 
Each project idea lists how many hours of contribution we typically expect the project to be. However, the students can propose their estimated work hours (350, 175, or 90 hours for the project) in the proposal.

Please also indicate the work hours (including the timezone) you hope to work on your project. 

**10) Planned absence/vacation days and other commitments during the GSoC period (including the community bonding period)**

Please indicate if you have any lectures/classes, examinations, or other personal commitments.

GSoC  also allows flexibility of an additional two months - to complete the project at a later time frame (a shift of up to 2 additional months). Please indicate if you expect to do that so we can plan accordingly.

If you choose a full-time project, you may not have much flexibility. However, if you are working on a small project, you can have several other parallel commitments.

**11) Skill Set**

Your relevant skill set to complete this project. Include pointers to bug fixes, demos, and previous work.

Also include pointers to the completed Code Challenge (if applicable).
