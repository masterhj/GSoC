The applicants to GSoC are evaluated based on several metrics.

These metrics include,

1. Successful completion of the Code Challanges (if any), prior contributions (pull requests/fixes) to the project, or related previous experience.

2. Understanding of the project idea, as established in the project proposal, prior GitHub discussions, and other communications with the mentors.

3. Other open source contributions to the specific project (other than through a previous GSoC with Alaska. A prior GSoC experience with Alaska is not counted).

4. Open source contributions to other Alaska projects (other than through a previous GSoC. A prior GSoC experience with Alaska is not counted).

5. Open source community spirit, as established through our GitHub forums, including assisting other applicants and newbie developers.

6. Prior open source contributions to other organizations (which can be highlighted through GitHub links).

7. Alignment with our vision "Many Traditions, One Alaska" as established through the GSoC Proposal and GitHub Discussions.

8. Strength of the applicant bio.

9. Ability to contribute and commit the specified time frame (i.e., 350 hours for the full-time project, 175 hours for the medium projects, and 90 hours for small projects).

10. Willingness and capacity to work with Alaska beyond the GSoC timeframe as collaborators, committers, and future GSoC mentors.


Please note that GSoC is competitive. Oftentimes, Google offers organizations fewer slots than we asked for. However, we will try to mentor as many projects as possible. For 2025, we have 15 project ideas listed and 17 mentors available. We have sufficient mentoring capacity.
